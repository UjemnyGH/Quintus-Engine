# Quintus-Engine

Quintus engine is basicly the 5th generation of game engine that
i am working on. Some of them are non-public, some of them even
never appear on github.
Here you have my public game engines on github (obviusly unfinished):

[AwesomeV2](https://github.com/UjemnyGH/AwesomeV2)

Documentation (unfinished):

### Libraries used in project:

Remember that this list can and propably change future to including only libs
that controls graphics, audio etc. becouse handling these things can be hard and
sometimes it`s OS related. But still I want to write as much as by my own like 
math, image, font, 3D model loader libraries, you know simple stuff where file
format, knowledge about topic or functioning something really matters.

1. GLFW
2. GLAD
3. GLM
4. stb_image
5. stb_truetype

##### ImGui library:
[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
